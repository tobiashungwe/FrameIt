# Frameit Repository

Welcome to the Frameit project! This repository includes submodules for managing documentation and source files, as well as Git hooks to streamline development workflows.

## Key Setup Steps

After cloning the repository, Git will automatically set up some custom hooks (like pushing to both GitHub and GitLab). This happens when you check out the main branch for the first time.

However, if you ever need to manually set up the hooks or something seems off, simply run:

```bash
./setup-hooks.sh
