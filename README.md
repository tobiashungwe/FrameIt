# Frameit Repository

Welcome to the Frameit project! This repository includes submodules for managing documentation and source files, as well as Git hooks to streamline development workflows.

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a gamification system that enhances traditional sports lessons by applying dynamic, customizable themes like Brawl Stars, Fortnite, and more. It will allow instructors to upload existing lesson plans and apply a game layer to make sessions more engaging for children and young adults. 

## Key Features:
- Gamification layer application for sports lessons.
- Theme customization for different activities.
- Real-time collaboration for instructors.
- User-friendly interface for lesson creation and customization.

## How to Use:
1. Log in and upload a lesson plan.
2. Select a gamification theme (e.g., Brawl Stars, Fortnite).
3. Customize the session as needed and share it with students.
4. Track student engagement through integrated analytics.


## Key Setup Steps

After cloning the repository, Git will automatically set up some custom hooks (like pushing to both GitHub and GitLab). This happens when you check out the main branch for the first time.

However, if you ever need to manually set up the hooks or something seems off, simply run:

```bash
./setup-hooks.sh
```
